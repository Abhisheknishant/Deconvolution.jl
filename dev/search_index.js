However, these conditions are difficult to met (and, of course, if you know the original signal you do not need to perform a deconvolution in order to recover the signal itself), but a strenght of the Wiener deconvolution is that it works in the frequency domain, so you only need to know with good precision the power spectra of the signal and the noise. In addition, most signals of the same class have fairly similar power spectra and the Wiener filter is insensitive to small variations in the original signal power spectrum. For these reasons, it is possible to estimate the original signal power spectrum using a representative of the class of signals being filtered.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Deconvolution.jl","title":"Deconvolution.jl","text":"For a short review of the Wiener deconvolution method see http://www.dmf.unisalento.it/~giordano/allow_listing/wiener.pdf and references therein.","category":"page"},{"location":"#","page":"Deconvolution.jl","title":"Deconvolution.jl","text":"The wiener function can be used to apply the Wiener deconvolution method to a digital signal.
